For the Claflin Chatbot Scheduling feature, my role was the designer. I created all of the flow charts and the data flow diagrams. 

In order to get to the final code for the system, you go to this public repository.
https://github.com/bibekitani34/Claflin-Chatbot-Schedule.git 
All of the files and code are under the branch named Claflin.

In order to open the program, you go to this webapp.
